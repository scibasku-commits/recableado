June 2025. 72 years old. 42 years in the travel business.

And I had no f***ing clue what a "prompt" was.

I signed up for an AI course because I noticed my competitors were selling trips with chatbots while I was still using Excel 2003. On the first day, the teacher said: *"We're going to optimize your prompts with few-shot learning techniques based on dataset context."*

I thought: "Wrong class. This is for NASA engineers."

Turns out it wasn't. Turns out these scary buzzwords are **surprisingly simple** when someone explains them without the jargon of a bearded hipster coding in a coffee shop.

This is what I wish I'd known on day one.

## The 5 Terms That Saved My Life

### 1. **Prompting** (or "how to talk to the machine without pissing it off")

**What it is:** The way you talk to AI. Like ordering coffee from a waiter: if you say "coffee," you get a black espresso. If you say "latte, hot, large cup, no sugar," you get exactly what you want.

**My real example (June 2025):**
❌ BAD: "Give me a ski trip"
✅ GOOD: "Act as a travel agent specializing in luxury skiing. Client: couple aged 40-50, intermediate level, budget €8,000, prefer Swiss Alps, traveling in February, want 5* ski-in/ski-out hotel. Give me 3 options with itinerary, itemized prices, and après-ski activities."

**What I learned:** The more specific, the better. AI doesn't guess. You're the boss.

---

### 2. **Training** (or "teaching it your world")

**What it is:** Feeding AI with YOUR specific information. Like onboarding a new salesperson: you hand them the catalogs, company policies, price lists. AI does the same thing, but in 30 seconds.

**My real example (July 2025):**
I uploaded PDFs from 47 liveaboard boats (diving cruises) with itineraries, prices, and technical specs. I told ChatGPT: *"You're a Red Sea liveaboard expert. Answer questions based ONLY on these documents."*

Result: An assistant that knew every cabin, every dive route, every high/low season price. Better than my own memory.

**What I learned:** AI without your data = generic. AI WITH your data = pure gold.

---

### 3. **Memory** (or "don't forget who I am")

**What it is:** AI's ability to remember previous conversations. Like when your doctor has your medical history and you don't have to remind them every single visit that you're allergic to penicillin.

**My real example (August 2025):**
I told ChatGPT about my ski holiday in Zermatt back in 1987 (yes, 39 years ago). Later, when I asked for help creating content about skiing in Switzerland, it generated text with references to *"the untouched magic of Zermatt you've known for decades."*

I hadn't mentioned Zermatt again. **It remembered.**

**What I learned:** Memory turns AI from "tool" to "coworker who actually knows you."

---

### 4. **Dataset** (or "the knowledge warehouse")

**What it is:** An organized collection of information that AI uses to learn or respond. Think of a massive library, but in digital form.

**My real example (September 2025):**
I built a dataset from supplier emails (hotels, airlines, DMCs) with confirmations, prices, and cancellation policies. I trained AI on that dataset to automatically extract: hotel name, dates, room count, total price, conditions.

Before: 15 minutes reading each email.
After: 10 seconds. AI reads, extracts, formats.

**What I learned:** Good dataset = effortless automation. Bad dataset = garbage processed at high speed.

---

### 5. **Context** (or "giving it the right clues")

**What it is:** The specific information you give AI in EACH conversation so it understands what you're talking about. It's not what it remembers (that's memory) — it's what you tell it *right now*.

**My real example (October 2025):**
Without context: *"Write me an email to a client"*
With context: *"Write an email to Juan Rodríguez, a client who booked a Maldives liveaboard in April, cancelled due to a family emergency, now wants to reschedule for October. Tone: empathetic, professional, offer 10% discount for the inconvenience."*

The first email: generic, flat, useless.
The second email: perfect, human, straight to the point.

**What I learned:** Context = the difference between a clueless assistant and a brilliant one.

## The Plot Twist

Today, 8 months after writing that "dictionary for the lost":

- I design custom GPTs that train my sales team
- I automate workflows with Make and n8n running in parallel
- I have 5 Claude Code agents working simultaneously on different tasks
- I process supplier emails in seconds with AI that extracts data and creates case files

Secret? None.

I just learned these 5 terms. And used them every single day.

## For You, Just Getting Started

If you're in June 2025 like I was (lost, overwhelmed, thinking "this isn't for me"), listen up:

**You're not stupid. This is normal.**

It took me 3 months to understand what a "dataset" was. Another 2 months to apply "context" properly. And I didn't grasp the difference between "memory" and "training" until September.

But once you master these 5 terms, everything else follows.

Because these 5 terms are **the foundation of everything**. The rest is just technical frosting.

### PS for My Fellow 70-Somethings

Yes, it can be done. I'm 72 and writing this from a Mac Mini that runs AI agents 24/7 while I sleep.

You don't need to be an engineer. You need curiosity and patience.

And a good dictionary.

**Did this dictionary help?** Share it with someone who's where you were 8 months ago. Sometimes all it takes is someone translating the jargon for you.
